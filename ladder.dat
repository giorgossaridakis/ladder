You are a Lad trapped in a maze.  Your mission is to explore the
dark corridors never before seen by human eyes and find hidden
treasures and riches.

You control Lad by typing the direction buttons and jumping by
typing SPACE.  But beware of the falling rocks called Der rocks.
You must find and grasp the treasure (shown as $) BEFORE the
bonus time runs out.

A new Lad will be awarded for every 10,000 points.
Extra points are awarded for touching the gold
statues (shown as &).  You will receive the bonus time points
that are left when you have finished the level.

Remember, there is more than one way to skin a cat. (Chum)

Type an ESCape to pause the game.

Good luck Lad.
